    <!-- Game Summary -->
    <p class="summary">
      In Mario Party DS, players participate in a party game where they roll dice to move around interactive boards, aiming to collect the most Stars by the end of the game. There are eight playable characters: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Princess Daisy, Toad, Wario, and Waluigi. The game features five different boards, each with unique rules for obtaining Stars. Most Stars are earned by collecting coins, which can be gathered by landing on specific spaces or winning minigames. Coins can also be used to purchase items that aid players in gaining an advantage.<br>

The central goal of the game is to collect more Stars than your opponents, and the player with the most Stars at the end is crowned the "Superstar." At the end of the game, additional Bonus Stars are awarded based on random criteria, such as winning the most minigames or using the most items. In the last five turns, a "Final 5 Frenzy" event occurs, where Bowser helps the player in last place, giving them extra coins or even a Star, depending on the outcome of a roulette wheel. This event also introduces spaces where players can duel for Stars or coins.<br>
