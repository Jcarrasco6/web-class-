    <!-- Game Summary -->
    <p class="summary">

        The story begins with Mario and Bowser engaged in a fierce battle on Bowser’s Airship, with Princess Peach on board. Bowser is determined to marry Peach and has already kidnapped Tiara, Cappy’s sister, to use as her wedding headdress. After a dramatic fight, Mario’s cap is destroyed, but Cappy, a Bonneter, finds a piece of it and awakens Mario in the Cap Kingdom. Together, Mario and Cappy team up to stop Bowser’s wedding plans and rescue both Peach and Tiara. As they journey through various kingdoms, Mario learns to harness Cappy’s unique abilities, including capturing objects and enemies to aid their mission.<br>
        
        Throughout their adventure, Bowser steals key items for the wedding, such as the Binding Band, the Lochlady Dress, and the Soirée Bouquet. These thefts cause disturbances in the kingdoms, including a cold desert and an unusual temperature drop. After battling Bowser’s hired wedding planners, the Broodals, Mario and Cappy manage to restore their ship, the Odyssey, and continue their pursuit of Bowser. Their travels lead them through several kingdoms, including New Donk City and Luncheon Kingdom, before finally confronting Bowser in the Cloud Kingdom. Bowser attempts to stop them by sending a dragon after the Odyssey, but Mario and Cappy persevere, eventually reaching Bowser’s Castle on the Moon.<br>
        
        The final showdown takes place in the Moon Kingdom, where Bowser prepares for his wedding to Peach. Mario and Cappy disrupt the ceremony, and Bowser engages them in a battle. After defeating Bowser, Mario and Cappy attempt to escape with Peach and Tiara, but the area begins collapsing. Peach rejects both Bowser’s and Mario’s proposals and leaves with Cappy and Tiara. In the end, Mario and Cappy return to the Mushroom Kingdom, continuing their adventures to collect Power Moons, while Peach and Tiara explore the kingdoms on their own.
