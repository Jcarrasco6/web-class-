    <p class="summary">
        The gameplay is much like the previous Super Mario Galaxy game where Mario must travel across many galaxies and planets and collect Power Stars.The stars can be found by defeating bosses, finding silver stars, going through a challenging obstacle course like stage, or completing some other type of objective. Early on, each galaxy contains very few stars in comparison to the previous Mario games. After the first 120 Stars are collected, the amount of Stars that are available in each galaxy doubles. The latter 120 Stars are green and can be found in tough to reach places. After collecting 240 Stars, the final galaxy, titled the Grandmaster Galaxy, becomes available. It is an extremely challenging stage that contains two Stars. The second Star, and the final Star in the entire game, can only be accessed after collecting the Comet Medal in the galaxy, and having 9,999 Star Bits in the bank. The game once again has a linear style of gameplay, but with a greater resemblance to the 2D games.<br>
        
        The game's hub world is a planetoid in the shape of Mario's face (the characters jokingly call it a faceship) called Starship Mario. The starship is used to gain access to the different galaxies and worlds. There are seven worlds in all, each one containing a certain amount of galaxies. New galaxies are made available upon completing missions and collecting stars. There are blockades placed in the various worlds that prevent further progression until the player can accumulate a set amount of stars. A blockade is always placed directly before the final galaxy of a world.
