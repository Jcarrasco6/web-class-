    <!-- Game Summary -->
    <p class="summary">
        Super Mario 3D World is a linear 3D platform game with gameplay similar to the 2D games. The player must navigate through levels, defeating enemies and collecting power-ups on the way. The player clears a level by reaching the Goal Pole at the end before losing a life or running out of time. The player can store collected power-ups in the item storage, allowing them to be collected by pressing . The player can also collect Green Stars and stamps, which allow the player to unlock certain levels or can be used in Miiverse posts, respectively. Points are earned by collecting items and defeating enemies, and are used to determine the player's high score in a level. The player completes the main game when they clear World Bowser and completes the entire game when all bonus worlds are complete and all Green Stars and stamps are collected. <br>
        On an evening in the Mushroom Kingdom, Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, and Toad come to view and enjoy the fireworks outside of Peach's Castle, when they discover a slanted Clear Pipe along the path. Mario and Luigi fix the Clear Pipe with hammers and wrenches, causing the pipe to eject a large number of items as well as a Sprixie Princess, a fairy-like creature of the Sprixie species. The Green Sprixie Princess begins to explain that Bowser has kidnapped six of her fellow Sprixie Princesses and that she needs their help; however, Bowser himself emerges from the pipe and traps the princess inside a bottle before disappearing back down the pipe with her. Peach, in trying to stop Bowser, falls down the pipe herself, and the others soon follow in order to assist her. The heroes soon end up in the Sprixie Kingdom, where the journey mainly takes place.<br>

After going through six worlds, the group encounter Bowser in World Castle, where he is keeping the Red Sprixie Princess; the only Sprixie Princess whom has not been saved yet. After the group successfully defeats Bowser, the Sprixie Princess is saved. The celebration is cut short, however, when Bowser ambushes them and grabs all seven Sprixie Princesses in a large bottle. With their combined power, he creates World Bowser: a theme park modeled after himself, and escapes to a tower.<br>

The heroes make their way through this world and encounter Bowser again in The Great Tower of Bowser Land. Here, Bowser uses a Super Bell to transform to Meowser and makes duplicates of himself, initiating the final battle. The group manages to defeat Meowser after climbing the tower and rescue all of the Sprixie Princesses. Now safe from Bowser, the princesses thank the heroes as they go through a Clear Pipe back to the Mushroom Kingdom.<br>
